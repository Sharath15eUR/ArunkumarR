Notes:
1. chown -> Changing Ownership (only the admin can change the owner of a file or directory)
syntax:
chown [options] ownername filename/directoryname
-R: To change the permission on files that are in the subdirectories of the directory.
-c: Change the permission for each file
-f: Prevents chown from displaying error messages. 


2. chmod -> It is used to change the access mode (Permissions) of one or more files. 
Syntax:
chmode [options] mode filename
-c, -changes: Print information about the files that are changed. 
File Permissions: 
r: Read
w: Write
x: Execute
s: Set user (or group) ID

3. chgrp -> It is used to change the group of one or more files to a new group 
Syntax: 
chgrp [options] newgroup files. 

4. Inode in Linux:
The inode number is a unique integer assigned to the device. 
We can use ls -i command to see the inode number of a file.
